# Delegations

Multiple companies use Plateit to process their number plate orders. If there is a plate type you would like to sell but don't have the means to manufacture it, it can be delegated to another company to fufil on your behalf automatically.

First, a delegator/delegatee relationship needs to be established. This can only be created by the Plateit administrator. Once set up, you will be able utilise this feature.
