# Delegations - Introduction

Many companies use Plateit to process their number plate orders. If there is a plate type you would like to sell but don't have the means to manufacture it, it can be delegated to another company to fufil on your behalf.

!>First, a delegator/delegatee relationship needs to be established. This can only be created by the Plateit administrator. Once set up, you will be able utilise this feature. You can have multiple delegatees for different products and plate types if required.

## How it Works

To help understand how delegations work, think of your own company as the `local` company and the delegated company as the `foreign` company.

There are two ways to achieve a delegation:

1. By manually creating a delegated package.
2. By utilising a helper endpoint to create an entire order, including its contents, in a single request.

[Part I](/delegations/method-01.md) will focus on the first method because it helps better illustrate how delegations are handled.

[Part II](/delegations/method-02.md) will discuss the latter method.
